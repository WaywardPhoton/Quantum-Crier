#### Quantum Computing Outreach Work

- [EGBC, Introduction to Quantum Computing](https://www.egbc.ca/Events/Events/2023/23NOVIQC) (2023). Updated and expanded previous offering into a 6-hour seminar.
  
- [Quantum Computing For Your Classroom](https://qmi.ubc.ca/news/bc-teachers-get-professional-development-course-in-quantum-computing/) (2022). Developed content for a course aimed at introducing high school students to quantum computing. The course is meant to be used by BC teachers, and integrates easily into the high school math and science curriculum in BC. 

- [EGBC, Introduction to Quantum Computing](https://www.egbc.ca/Events/Events/2022/22JUNIQC) (2022). Designed and taught a 4-hour seminar on quantum computing for Engineers and Geoscientists BC. The course was intended as a fun but comprehensive introduction to quantum computing, and strove to answer three fundamental questions: what is quantum computing, why do we need it, and what have we achieved so far? This was done interactively through the use of JupyterHub to deliver and synchronize activities.

- [Double Slit Experiments](https://openprocessing.org/user/307789?view=sketches)(2022). Used javascript and p5js to create a simple animation of the double slit experiment in the thin slit (point source approx) and thick slit cases. The simulations are being integrated into existing high school lab material that is aimed at making quantum computing accessible to a younger audience. 

- [STEM NYC](https://stemteachersnyc.org/quantum-computing-a-weird-wonderful-new-world/) (2021). Created and led a 2-day professional development workshop for STEM teachers in New York. Designed interactive activities (such as coding in IBM Quantum Lab) to introduce fundamentao quantum computing concepts and give teachers ideas for activities that can be integrated into their classroom.<br>
Coordinated with guest lecturers from the University of British Columbia to integrate cutting-edge research development into curriculum. Hosted the workshop on a shared server with Jupyterhub, to ensure teachers had access to material. Designed all graphics and coding activities for the workshop. A sample graphic that I made is shown below.

- Quantum Computing Summer Camp (2021). Created activities and content for a virtual summer camp for students grade 5-12. The goal of the camp was to introduce quantum computing in a fun way:  games, experiments, and quizzes were integrated into the material. I also created some of the coding activities and designed many of the graphics. <br>
The camp is a property of UBC but some of the material is found in the Jupyter Book linked above. The biggest challenge was to simplify content without taking away its essence: review came back overwhelmingly positive. Shown below is a character ('Q') I designed for the software team, which developed the games.
