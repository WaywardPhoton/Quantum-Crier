Hi! I'm Ana, an electrical engineer with a background in embedded systems and quantum computing. I graduated from the [QST Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/ubcqtl/home) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) in May 2023. 

I'm currently working as an integrated circuit designer for superconducting devices at [D-Wave](https://www.dwavesys.com) while building my own educational content consulting business part-time.

I'm also a rock climber and amateur mountaineer making the most of the beautiful South Coast mountains.
