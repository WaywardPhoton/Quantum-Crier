**Feb 2, 2024.** *And what a crazy year it's been.*

## Recap
What a wild ride the past year has been. I've truly pushed myself to pursue what makes me happy regardless of the difficulty or cost. In June 2023, I successfully defended my [MASc thesis](/ubc_2023_november_ciocoiu_antonia.pdf). I ended up quitting my job soon after due to burnout, and spent the next several months sailing, climbing, and generally bumming around western North America. Through connections I eventually landed a job working as an electrical contractor, repairing a Coast Guard vessel, which was definitely an interesting experience in the short term. Now, I'm happy to say that I've returned full time to working on quantum computing as a consultant for the Quantum Algorithms Institute!
