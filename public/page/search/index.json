[{"content":"Feb 2, 2024. And what a crazy year it\u0026rsquo;s been.\nRecap What a wild ride the past year has been. I\u0026rsquo;ve truly pushed myself to pursue what makes me happy regardless of the difficulty or cost. In June 2023, I successfully defended my MASc thesis. I ended up quitting my job soon after due to burnout, and spent the next several months sailing, climbing, and generally bumming around western North America. Through connections I eventually landed a job working as an electrical contractor, repairing a Coast Guard vessel, which was definitely an interesting experience in the short term. Now, I\u0026rsquo;m happy to say that I\u0026rsquo;ve returned full time to working on quantum computing as a consultant for the Quantum Algorithms Institute!\n","date":"2024-02-05T22:21:25-08:00","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/test/","title":"Recap"}]
